# weather-Dashboard
## Description
### Project purpose was to create a weather dashboard that displays current weather data upon searching a city by the user. Current forecast as well as a five-day forecast would be displayed on the page when user searches a desired city. Searches would also get stored in local stoarage and on the page and upon refreshing the page, previous searches would still be there. A weather API would be used to collect and display the data onto the page.
### User should be able to see a a clear header displayed and a search field where user can input a desired city. A main weather dashboard is also on the page where inofrmation of current weather data will be displayed based on the search input. In addtion, a five-day forecast is also displayed on the page underneath the main weather dashboard which diaplays predicted weather for the next five-days. 
## Technologies
### GitHub was used to clone a new repository onto a computer and was also used to deploy the website when edits where finished and final version needed to be deployed. Visual Studio Code was used to create HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to make a code from scratch. GitBash Terminal was used to git add/commit/push edits made from local repository onto GitHub to update website. Bootstrap was used to copy a grid system onto the HTML file to make the calander table format, as well as a jumbotron for the header. J-query was also used for some formatting and google fonts was used to set a font choice for the text. An API and an API key was used to access weather data and fetch/link it to the JavaScript file.
## Setup
### Tools needed are GitHub to name and clone repository onto local computer/repository. GitBash Terminal should be installed and one can clone repository with either an SSH key or the HTML URL and with the command-git clone-and copying in the URL or SSH key, upload to Terminal-making sure they are not within another folder but in the main branch-and using the commands git add . (press enter) then git commit -m "detailed description of your edits" (press enter) then git push (press enter) and entering their SSH key if promted. 
### A new folder should be created and once Visual Studio Code is installed, open the new folder in VS and make a new HTML file titled index.html, a new CSS folder titled style.css, and a new JavaScript folder called script.js and make sure that both the CSS and JavaScript folders are linked on the HTML file. The CSS stylesheet should be linked in the "head" section/tag while the JavaScript sheet should be linked on the bottom of the page in the "body" section/tag. Start adding to the HTML file and the CSS. Once that is completed, start on your JavaScript file and use the API and API key to link it to your JS file in order to access the data. View all changes and progress made in the "Open Browser" extention-search for and install "Open in Browser" extention in the VS side bar. 
### GitBash Terminal is once again needed to updload edits made in your local repository onto GitHub-using the same commands of git add ./git commit -m/git push in order for the changes to be displayed when website is deployed. Once changes are uploaded, navigate to the settings where your repository is displayed on GitHub and scroll down to Pages in the sidebar. Once there, under Source, select Branch:main and save. A link will then appear and although it will take time, the website will be ready.

## Status 
### Unfortunetly, weather dashboard still has a couple mistkaes that need to be corrected. Local stoarage does not work as previous user searches are not saved and stored on the page as well as date being displayed in unix time and not standard datetime.
